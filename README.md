## Chess Database 

As someone who is planning on getting into chess again,
<br> I have been looking for a chess database to study and,
<br> strategize my approach to different lines and openings.<br>
However, most databases are either online (chess.com, ...), or paid via a one-time or subscription payments.
<br>
As such, I thought it would be a great idea to code a chess database application of my own.<br>

*User stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a game into the database using FIDE notation.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the players of the match, the rankings of the players at the time of playing. Some
stats from each player such as win rate.
- User **cannot** determine the best move from a certain position. This is **NOT** a chess engine.

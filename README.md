## Chess Database 

As someone who is planning on getting into chess again,
<br> I have been looking for a chess database to study and,
<br> strategize my approach to different lines and openings.<br>
However, most databases are either online (chess.com, ...), or paid via a one-time or subscription payments.
<br>
As such, I thought it would be a great idea to code a chess database application of my own.<br>

*User stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple game into the database using FIDE notation.
- As a user, I want to be able to determine the winner of a game based on the notation and moves entered.
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple players to the database with their name, title, and win/loss record.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the players of the match, the rankings of the players.
- As a user, I want to be able to save all the newly added players and games upon exiting.
- As a user, I want to be able to load all the saved data and use it again.
- User **cannot** determine the best move from a certain position. This is **NOT** a chess engine.

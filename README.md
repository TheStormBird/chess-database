## Chess Database 

As someone who is planning on getting into chess again,
<br> I have been looking for a chess database to study and,
<br> strategize my approach to different lines and openings.<br>
However, most databases are either online (chess.com, ...), or paid via a one-time or subscription payments.
<br>
As such, I thought it would be a great idea to code a chess database application of my own.<br>

*User stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a game into the database via a csv file.
- As a user, I want to be able to retrieve a game and go over different moves (with a visual board on the side)
- As a user, I want to be able to see the players of the match, the rankings of the players at the time of playing. Some
stats from each player such as win rate, win rate with a certain opening, ...
- As a user, I want to be able to analyze an opening based on the probability of winning based on a certain move.
- User **cannot** determine the best move from a certain position. This is **NOT** a chess engine.
